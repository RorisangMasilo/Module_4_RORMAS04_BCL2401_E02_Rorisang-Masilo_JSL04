# [JSL04] Submission: Monster Ternary Operator

## Project Overview

### Description:

This project demonstrates the use of ternary operators in JavaScript to handle various scenarios related to Monster Energy drink preferences and other conditions.

#### Usage:

1. Flavor Selection: Determines whether the user prefers a "Regular" or "Sugar-free" variety of Monster Energy drink based on the user's preference variable.
2. Stock Check: Checks the remaining number of Monster Energy cans in the fridge and alerts if it's time to restock.
3. Workout Intensity: Advises whether the user needs a boost (Monster Energy drink) based on their current heart rate.
4. Temperature Suitability: Advises whether the Monster Energy drink is chilled to perfection or needs a cooler based on the current temperature.
5. Late Night Coding Session: Suggests whether it's a good idea to have a Monster Energy drink based on the current hour.

### Reflections

#### Areas of Mastery

**Conditional Statements:** Implemented clear and concise conditional statements to address each challenge.

#### Challenges Faced

**Understanding Conditions:** Interpreting the conditions for each challenge accurately and translating them into code logic required for myself to attention to detail.
**Time Management:** Balancing the time spent on each challenge, taking too much time to look/conjure up for the solution.
**Syntax Errors:** Avoiding syntax errors and ensuring the code syntax according JS principles.

#### Areas for Improvement

**Code Optimization:** While the solutions provided are functional, there may be opportunities to optimize the code further for readability or performance. - An area of improvement which a couple engineers have noted for me.
**Overall confidence in improving in general:** Personal development, time and discipline, especially for the desire to learning JS to override the desire to breakdown and cry.

#### Overall Learning Experience

This project was an invaluable hands-on experience in applying knowledge to the coding challenges &provided valuable hands-on experience. Slowly building the confidence by completing the challenges. Excited to tackling similar tasks in future projects.
